Simple usage:
    pagediff before <url>
      
This will produce a png file with the name before-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
          
    pagediff after <url>

This will produce a png file with the name after-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
and a comparisson file with the name output-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
                  
The url will be sanitized to make it into a half-decent filename.

Options:
  --help                  This help text
  --size=(height)x(width) Size of screen to use in pixels
  --config=(filename)     Load config from file
