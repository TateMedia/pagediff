Simple usage:
    pagediff before <url> <output-options>
      
This will produce a png file with the name before-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
          
    pagediff after <url> <output-options>
    
This will produce a png file with the name after-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
and a comparisson file with the name output-<url>-<width>x<height>.png
                  
The url will be sanitized to make it into a half-decent filename.

Options:
  --help                  This help text
  --size=(height)x(width) Size of screen to use in pixels
  --config=(filename)     Load config from file

Output options:

  --threshold=nn          Percentage of differing pixels needed before an output image is created. Default 0
  --hide-before-and-after Hide the before and after images in the output. Just show composite
  --before-dir=xxx        Directory to put the before image in.
